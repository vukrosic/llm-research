# LLM Research: FeedForward vs SwiGLU Comparison

## Why SwiGLU Outperforms Standard FeedForward

![Training Comparison](ff_vs_swiglu_comparison.png)

### Results Summary
- **Loss improvement**: +12.3%
- **Perplexity improvement**: +27.8%
- **Parameter overhead**: Only 1.12x more parameters

### Technical Explanation

**SwiGLU Architecture:**
```
SwiGLU(x) = (W₁x ⊙ σ(W₂x)) W₃
```
Where `⊙` is element-wise multiplication and `σ` is SiLU activation.

**Key Advantages:**

1. **Gated Activation**: The gating mechanism `W₁x ⊙ σ(W₂x)` allows selective information flow, creating more expressive representations than standard ReLU-based feedforward layers.

2. **Non-linear Interactions**: Unlike standard FF layers that apply activation then linear transformation, SwiGLU creates multiplicative interactions between two linear projections, enabling richer feature combinations.

3. **Improved Gradient Flow**: SiLU activation (`x * sigmoid(x)`) provides smoother gradients compared to ReLU, reducing training instability and dead neurons.

4. **Empirical Scaling**: Research shows SwiGLU consistently outperforms other activations (ReLU, GELU, Swish) across model sizes, with benefits increasing at scale.

### Training Dynamics

The plots show SwiGLU achieves:
- **Faster initial convergence** in both training and validation loss
- **Lower final loss** with better generalization
- **More stable training** with smoother loss curves

The 12% parameter increase is minimal compared to the 27.8% perplexity improvement, demonstrating SwiGLU's parameter efficiency.

### Implementation

Run comparison:
```bash
python compare_ff_swiglu.py
```

Toggle between architectures in `ModelConfig`:
```python
config = ModelConfig(use_swiglu=True)  # SwiGLU
config = ModelConfig(use_swiglu=False) # Standard FF
```
